The soul always feared of solitude\
Wanted to diffuse in chatters and waves of laughter,\
Put on mascara and lipsticks,\
Clink wine glasses and cheers,\
Tap those heals and dance,\
Bask in the sun with swanky glasses on,\
Lay back in arms and smell the warmth

Now, the soul is embracing this silence,\
where it can hear itself thinking,\
Sinking into forgotten pieces of life,\
rejuvenating forgotten relationships,\
Carving out a new beautiful skin that will\
hug the soul even tighter.. forever....

Kudos to all such souls in making :)
