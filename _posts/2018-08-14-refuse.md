Clicked in Goa,India during Summer'17.

Storms are harsh ruthlessly

to uproot me, to dismantle me.

but they are also kind enough,

to sweeten the after-breeze for me.

It is lovely to rise with the sun,

cook buoyant hopes, seasoned with efforts,

topped with dreams,every single day.

What is lovelier, is shattering by the dusk,

resolving the dilemma between

rejuvenating or giving up by the end of the day.

*But I refuse to give up*

Because giving up is too tough,

How can I bargain for the exhilarating thrill?

Can you??
