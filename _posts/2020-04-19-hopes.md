title: Hopes and Milestones
---



Baffled by myself,

I looked around for inspiration or let's say it as the NEXT *hope.*

Ridiculously torn between whether to accept it as *hope *or not,

I struggle with none other than my own muddling mind.

My inchoate ideas yell frantically to take up,

but the baggage of my past failures simply nod a NO

After contemplating, I finally end this row.

A ray of hope can guide my life- at least for a few days

I can now sleep peacefully in this phase,

to wake up tomorrow with an aim to chase.

This shall continue till I flag the milestone

boasting of my success in achieving or maybe just touching the goal.

After which again starts a viscous cycle of hopes and milestones.
