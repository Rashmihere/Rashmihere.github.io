Recently, I have been trying to work on my storytelling skills.
*(No, I am not trying to become the "storyteller" on LinkedIn)*

In my hunt for resources, I met this brilliant piece of storytelling - "The commode story" (Yes, I was living under the rock). It is an excerpt from the classic movie " The Reservoir Dogs" by Tarantino.


**Context (Spoiler Alert)**

The commode story is an imaginary "cool" story narrated by an undercover cop (Mr. Orange) to a gang. The purpose is to impress the gang and be part of them in their future heists. So you see the stakes were quite high.

The movie is in itself a gem because of its sheer brilliant storytelling and film-making. I am only highlighting the practical takeaways from "the commode story" to keep this blog short.


- **Little details matter**: Mr. Holdaway is the one who trains Mr. Orange in perfecting his narration. He gives a simple and important advice - memorise all the little details (even if they sound unimportant) and rest he can make up the story. IRL as well, these little details feed the curiosity of the listeners, transitions them to the world of the story, fills all the blanks, and finally make the speaker convincing. This can be applied to various practical storytelling scenarios. *Example: During behavorial interviews, answering to questions like "Tell me about a time when you managed your conflicting stakeholders", you should remember the context, detailed problem statement, project goals, impact, why did you pick it up, what did you finally achieve, etc.* 

- **Find the story behind the story** - Dig deep into the content/story and question every part of it. This can uncover many hidden surprises and stories hence bringing clarity and confidence. Stand-up comedians are some of the finest storytellers. Their most hilarious jokes are well narrated and timed stories revolving around very familiar situations. They bring out the unheard stories of characters and situation that we would have never thought of otherwise.

- **Practice** - *keep sayin it, keep sayin it, keep sayin it*
 Whenever I listen to someone speaking confidently and making sense at the same time, I am in total awe. I can be caught noticing the body language, the speed, the pauses, and the flow of the speaker. However, whenever I take the stage, I am honestly never impressed with myself. For folks like me, a promising way could be practice to the extent till it becomes natural. Mr. Orange practices his story with multiple improvisations in different elements such that on the final day he narrates the story as if the incident actually happened. (This bit is crazy and a must watch sequence in the movie). Lets normalise practising presentations and product demos :P.

Also, I recommend watching this well-articulated [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoM8AlEyjws) on more storytelling lessons from the movie.
