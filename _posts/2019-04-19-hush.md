Wailing sirens of the struggling rescue vans

screeching tires of the rushing sedans

hammering sound of the construction next doors

the punctilious roaring of the religious chores

the rage of that shouting news anchor

joyfully making and faking his candor

the regular chimes of phone notifications

the noise of lads boasting their vacations

My peace has taken its toll

I am yearning for a lullaby to my soul

how crazy were the mornings with birds' tweets

silence breaking barks of dogs in the lone streets

the hourly clang of the school lunchtime bell

feet crushing the rustling leaves in autumn spell

the echoing chants of the street hawker

monsoons humming with the droplets of water

Maybe all I need is a "Hush" !!!

Maybe all I need is a "Hush" !!!
Maybe all I need is a "Hush" !!!
