The mirror was tinted by the glowing mist,\
there was a world in every drop that was resting on it.

In that, I saw the naked me\
I looked beautiful and happy.

Though the crystals on the glass made it heavy\
The euphoria draped my body

That's when I wanted to adore myself a little more\
I wiped off all the shimmering stones

Demystifying the real me\
There were so many scars to see

Faded scars from the past\
Fresh scars trying to hide under the mask

Scars graved deep down the flesh\
So much that they are reflected in every sense

The soul is now enjoying this warmth\
Molded to steadfast against coming storms

Ah! It rained again\
and the charm in the glass remain
