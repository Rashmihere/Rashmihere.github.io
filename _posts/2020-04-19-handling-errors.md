Who do you blame when you accidentally forget to turn off the gas knob?\
*"Oops that slipped my mind (because I picked up cooking only during quarantine times hence mistake by a novice)"*

Who do you blame when you accidentally press the power button instead of the volume up button on your phone?\
*"Why do I keep forgetting this every time?"*

Who do you blame when you cannot find a suitable place to rest your arms in an airplane?\
"*How rude is the next person sitting to me ðŸ˜¦ "*

* * * * *

Throughout the day, we all face many such situations where we make mistakes. In many such instances, we often end up questioning ourselves and our attention.

I recently read a very famous book (*in almost all the Must read design books collection*) "[The Design of everyday things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=P4IoCulDEN&rank=1)" by Donald A Norman.

He highlights how such instances mustÂ notÂ always be attributedÂ to human errorÂ --- there can be a much deeper reason --- may be a design fault.

And Woahhhh!\
That suddenly gave me so much confidence in my day to day errands.\
I no longer question myself every time --- I rather question the fundamental design of every system and guess what --- that opens up a plethora of opportunities.

Here are a few quick takeaways that can be helpful for anyone who is creating products/designs and using products:

Slips and Mistakes
------------------

Don norman classifies errors into two categories: Slips and mistakes

SlipsÂ being the ones that we do unconsciously when we intend to do something else.Â *E.g forgetting to collect the card from atm machines*

MistakesÂ are the ones where we define wrong actions and wrong plan.\
*E.g setting a password without knowing the rules.*

What can we do as "creators"?
-----------------------------

-   Let's revisit assumptions in designing productsÂ --- Products are usually designed with an assumption that the user will be inÂ alert consciousÂ position every time.\
    However, in the real world, a human is struggling with many otherÂ interruptionsÂ in life.\
    Hence, apart from a few exceptions (*safety-related products*) --- the basic assumption should be to design products thatÂ convey their meaningÂ to users even when they areÂ interrupted.\
    This can make their life super chill (*Fewer errors, Less retrospection of error)*
-   Sensibility Checks ---Doing simple "common sense" tests can be a small delightful experience to users who unintentionally made an error (*slip).\
    *Small checks can avoid bigger hassles in a user journey.\
    *Eg In Amazon.com --- if duplicate items are added to cart, they show a simple message to remind the users.*

Amazon.com --- Duplicate items in cart

-   Communicate not punishâ€Š---â€ŠWhenever an error occurs, there can be dissatisfaction sentiments at the user end.\
    However, it can be seen as an opportunity to design systems whichâ€Š---\
    - Communicate the error clearly and crisply\
    - Be empathetic to the user\
    - Tell clearly about theÂ next steps\
    Some teams go creative and grasp such opportunities to make it a delightful experience

Broken URL handled with creativity

-   Make actions reversible --- "Fear" of the outcome can be a barrier in any user journey.

    Making actions reversible provides a sense of freedom where users can play around, learn, make mistakes, and explore the product.

> UndoÂ is powerful

-   *While heart skips a beat every time an email (usually sensitive) is sent- however if you want to make any last-minute change, Gmail gives a chance by providing "Undo"*

-   Add constraints to avoid error conditions ---Â As our doctors told us "Prevention is better than cure"\
    Instead of informing a user about the errors after they have spent 5 minutes in filling a form --- why don't we make systems which eliminate any room of errors.

-   Confirmation and success messages ---Â These messages are assumed to be part of a process flow by default.\
    However, their importance is highlighted only whenÂ they are missing.\
    Telling users about the state and impact of any action keeps them informed.\
    *Eg: Deleting photos from google photos*

Concluding with a famous quote in the book (*and one of my favorites):*

> "We must design for the way people behave,\
> not for how we would wish them to behave."
