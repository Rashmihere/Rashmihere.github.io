Each day during the quarantine period has been a different day.\
There were days when I had to drag myself from bed to the work-desk.

There were also days when I was super productive- ✔️ ticked off every item in my checklist.

Me on a super-productive day

But all I was missing was consistency. Along with work, there were daily chores and cooking that had to be done since we had to let go of any kind of house-help.

While WFH gave an illusion of ample "Me" time initially. Unfortunately, I lost control of time like never before.

This is where is discovered --- [Forest App](https://www.forestapp.cc/). This was after experimenting with a few other tools and techniques. I wanted to implement Cal Newport's famous technique [Time Blocking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-El9i6S73A&ab_channel=SparshPaliwal)

My JBTD is to focus on my work/task for a set period of time ⏰.

> Stay focused, be present\
>  --- Tagline of Forest

Forest App uses the famous [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Here are a few key things about the app 👇

1.**Emotional Rewards 🎁 ---** Forest App sets a timer to say 25 minutes. Within this time period, a virtual tree will be planted in your virtual forest. You can add tags to each of them to later track where did you spend your focus time.
    On a successful plantation, you earn some coins. You can use these coins to [plant real trees.](https://trees.org/sponsor/forest-app/)
    Hence, there are two rewards:

-  You could focus for 20 minutes
  - You earned coins which can be spent for a noble cause

2.**Effective** ⏰ --- The product has quite rightly identified the functional and emotional needs of the user:
- Reminder to guide back from distractions --- Every time you open any other app, you will receive a notification reminding of "Your tree is still growing"
- Making it hard to "Give Up" --- In case you are distracted and want to leave the app, they subtly (read ruthlessly) ask to **give up** and let a tree die :(

Which one would you want to see?

3.**User Investment for motivating the user to keep coming back ---**

 Every virtual plan added to the forest or withered is displayed in a forest layout with stats to show the number of days when you focused more. You would want to fill this forest with trees and hence would use the app to set focus times.

This section gives daily/weekly/monthly analysis.

4.**Minimalist ---** As of the date of writing this article, the app has just enough features to get the job done. It does not have an overload of features which makes it a very clean app.

*Note:* As of now, I have used and experienced only the free version of the app. The Pro version of the app has many other exclusive features like detailed visualization of focus time, custom tags, gamification, and social features.

That being said, there is always a room for improvement :

- **Easier tagging** --- The UX of tagging my focus time to different activities (like reading, sports, family time) can be improved to make it smoother.Currently, this feature goes underutilized.

- **Integrate calendar** --- At the face of it, this looks to be powerful integration. This can make visualization of focus time even better at Forest App and give more control of time.
