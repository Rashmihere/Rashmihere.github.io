## Notes from Suhail Doshi's talk at YC

I recently watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MABmQhOlmJA) by YC where Suhail Doshi (Co-founder of Mixpanel) talks on how to discover important facts about products.

Since the lecture's transcript and slides links are broken, 
I have listed down my takeaways here for a quick 2 minutes read.


While defining metrics of any product, we should be able to answer 3 broad-level questions
about the product

1. Is the product **easy to understand?**

    Users visiting an app or website can be acquired only when they are able to make sense of the product
and find it relevant.
     Key metrics which can be helpful in tracking this:

     - No. of Visitors & No. of Signups -  *This metric helps in iterating on landing pages design and in figuring out optimum design to make this step as easy as possible*

     - Ratio of Single page visits to multiple pages engagement  - *Are users just visiting single pages and leaving or are they exploring more than that*

- In a B2B product > No. of visits to pricing page - *Shows intent and interest of users*
2. Is the product **easy to get started?**

     Users should be able to get the value proposition of the product easily.
     Key metrics which can be helpful in tracking this:

     - No. of users doing a valuable activity - *Basically defining what "active" is in Daily active users". This can be as simple as doing a search*

     - Time taken to do a valuable activity on the app/website - *How easy/difficult it is for the users to finish a valuable task*

     Additionally, 

     - Measure funnel of the entire experience - from landing page to a valuable activity - Helps in identifying gaps and opportunities in user journey

     -  Don't try to optimise for bad/fake actors.

     - Try to make this step easier by reducing steps in starting with the product *e.g Google never asks for signing up / logging in before googling*

3. Are people **coming back to use the product?** 


     No matter how many new users a product is able to acquire, it is the returning users that play a key role in defining long term success of a product.
     Key metrics which can be helpful in tracking this:

   - % of new users coming back in 1 week / 30 days - *Helps in understanding how valuable the product is for the users*

   - More focus on DAU than MAU - *MAU can be just another vanity metrics and may not give a clear picture of the stickiness of product*

   - In B2B space - More focus on Revenue churn.  *More on revenue churn  https://tomtunguz.com/negative-churn/*

Often as Product Managers, we may want to measure a bunch of things and may ultimately land on a web of metrics. Suhail emphasises on **keeping it simple**. Chasing a north star metric accompanied by a few major metrics guides the teams in a better direction.


So, while deciding metrics (and so to say any goals in life), keep asking this one question

 **What am I optimising for?**
