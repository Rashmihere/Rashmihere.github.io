What if the birds never discovered their wings to fly,

to the stretch of mountains ,to the Zenith,

high above, to rule the sky.

What if the Lion never hunted his targets down

to their fate, to his supremacy

to hold the king crown.

What if we never took those first steps

to explore the colors of this world,

to enjoy and live its shades.

What if he never initiated the first kiss,

to make life beautiful to me,to define love to me

which could otherwise be a miss.

What if my fears are holding me back today

from falling tomorrow,learning and rising back

the day after tomorrow !!!
