## Notes from Suhail Doshi's talk at YC

I recently watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MABmQhOlmJA) by YC where Suhail Doshi (Co-founder of Mixpanel) details on how startups should think about discovering the important facts about how their product is used.

Since the lecture's transcript and slides link is broken, I have listed down my takeaways here for a quick 2 minutes read.

While defining metrics of a product, we should be able to answer 3 broad-level questions
about the product

1. Is the product **easy to understand?**

    - No. of Visitors & No. of Signups 
        - *This is the first step of users towards your product. This metric helps in iterating on landing pages design and in figuring out optimum design to make this step as easy as possible*


    - Ratio of Single page visits to multiple pages engagement
        - *Are users just visiting single pages and leaving or are they exploring more than that*

    - In a B2B product > No of visits to pricing page 
        - *Shows intent and interest of users*



2. Is the product **easy to get started?**:

    - No. of users doing a valuable activity 

        - *Basically defining what "active" is in Daily active users". This can be as simple as doing a search*

    - Time taken to do a valuable activity on the app/website 
        - *How easy/difficult it is for the users to finish a valuable task*

    - Measure funnel of the entire experience - from landing page to a valuable activity
        - *Helps in identifying gaps and opportunities*

    Additiional notes: 
        
    -  Don't try to optimise for bad/fake actors.
    - Try to make this step easier by reducing steps in starting with the product eg Google never asks for signing up / loggin in before googling

3. Are people **coming back to use the product**
    - % of new users coming back in 1 week / 30 days 
        - *Helps in understanding how valuable the product is for the users*

    - More focus on DAU than MAU 

        - *MAU can be just another vanity metrics and may not give a clear picture of the stickiness of product* 

    - In B2B space - More focus on Revenue churn  
        More on revenue churn  https://tomtunguz.com/negative-churn/

        - *Helps giving clearer picture of churn rate*

Often as Product Managers we may want to measure a big bunch of things and may ultimately land on a web of metrics, Suhail emphasises on **keeping it simple**. Chasing behind a north star metric accompanied by a few major metrics guides the teams in better directions.


So, while deciding metrics (and so to say any goals in life), keep asking this one question

- **What am I exactly optimising for?**
