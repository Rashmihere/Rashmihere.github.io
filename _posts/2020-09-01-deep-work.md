Deep Work --- The book by Cal Newport stresses the importance of 'ability to focus without distraction' in the world which is continuously evolving with ubiquitous sources of distraction.

As a quick read, these notes cover pretty much everything, however, I recommend reading the book to get most out of it.

The book is broadly divided into two parts:

1\. Why deep work? --- This may sound trivial as we all assume that we know how important focused work is. However, Cal Newport convinces the readers why deep work is valuable, rare, and meaningful with rationales derived from the lives of highly focused people.

2\. How to do deep work? --- Once the readers have rationally accepted the importance of deep work, the book helps them with simple rules helpful in focusing on deep work.

Why Deep Work?
==============

1\. Deep work is valuable --- The economy demands individuals who can produce irreplaceable results. Shallow work like sending emails, making calls, repeated tasks will be replaced/automated soon.\
Hence, we need two core abilities to keep up the game:

-   Learn hard things quickly --- Converging all rays of attention to the specific skill that we are trying to improve makes it easier to learn hard things.\
    Note: Converging rays of attention also means deflecting rays of distraction.
-   Produce high-quality output --- Mastering a skill is incomplete if we don't produce what we have learned.\
    High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) X (Intensity of Focus)\
    In switching context from one task to another, a part of our attention is stuck thinking about the original task. This attention residue reduces the intensity of the task you want to focus on.

How attention residue transients over time

Working deeply on a single task without switching tasks minimizes the negative effects of attention residue hence maximizing performance.

2\. Deep Work is Rare --- TBH, we think that if we want to focus one day on a task, we will sit down, stretch for a couple of hours and get the deep work done. However, it is not as easy as it sounds. We have a constant urge to turn our attention towards something superficial.

Here are a few things that we need to acknowledge (because we are already aware of these reasons)

-   Shallow work is the least resisting --- Imagine, you are focusing on a task in your office hours and you run out of ideas or the task looks cumbersome. The next thing your eyes would want to check is the notifications on your phone. No matter, this saves us from the short term discomfort of concentration but it is at the cost of long term benefits of focus.
-   Lack of measurable metrics --- There is a metrics black hole to measure the effects of deep work or the effects of shallow work. This deeply undermines the importance of deep work and hence is neglected.
-   Cult of the Internet --- Well, Product Managers in content companies are competing to buy your attention to their app. Need I elaborate more on that? XD XD

3\. Deep work is meaningful --- No matter how philosophical this may sound but "Your world is the outcome of what you pay attention to".

-   Helps ignore irrelevant things --- Once you are absorbed in deep work, there is no room to think about avoidable and less pleasant things (and the world just becomes a happier place to live). This is one major advantage for overthinkers like me :P
-   Brings satisfaction --- Can you recall the last time you pushed yourself voluntarily to achieve something challenging? Well, can you also recall the immediate feeling after completing that hustle?\
    This satisfaction is priceless.

How to do Deep Work?
====================

This section lists the rules that can help us structure our deep work.\
I know many of you might have skimmed the blog directly to this section\
Well, here are the rules.

1.  Ritualise --- While there is no correct deep work ritual. You should choose your own style of deep-work but never forget to maintain consistency.\
    This ritual can include details like where to work, how to work, and the supports needed to work (like a cuppa ☕️).\
    You might end up experimenting with your rituals for some time till you find your fit ritual.
2.  Follow the 4DX Framework (The four disciplines of execution)---

-   Focus on wildly important --- Prioritise your goals and then set small, specific, and ambitious goals to focus on. Let's say you are focusing on becoming better at writing, your goal could be to publish 5 blogs in a month.
-   Act on lead measures --- In the above goal, the lag measure is the no. of blogs published, however, you cannot do much about it in the short term. However, a lead measure is a time spent in researching/writing blogs. This is more relevant and actionable.
-   Keep a scoreboard --- Measuring helps to stay on toes. This also refines our expectations of how much deep work is needed to achieve the expected results.
-   Be accountable --- Regularly review your previous week and plan your week ahead. Adjust your schedules and plans based on learnings from the past week.

3\. Reward yourself downtime --- In this downtime, you can restore and recharge the energy needed to work deeply. Often, in these downtimes, we find ourselves checking phone notifications or responding to emails and hence compromising with the attention restoration time.

4.Embrace Boredom --- Our brains are wired to on-demand distraction. "Waiting in a queue, let me check my Instagram". This rewiring can be done by consistent training of the brain. Hence, while working on developing a skill there will be days when you will be bored and will crave distraction.

-   Dodge loops and distractions --- In the middle of focusing on a task, you may recall an incident at your work that irked you. You need to face this and remark to yourself that you have already thought about it enough. Acknowledge that you are stuck in a loop and then redirect your attention to the next step of your deep work.
-   Structure your work --- Before sitting down to focus, pre-define the steps you are planning to take to achieve the expected outcome. This gives a direction to your work and makes it less boring.

5\. Schedule Internet use --- Internet is a hurdle in the journey to enhance concentration. Slack pings, hangout calls, and seemingly urgent emails clutter the limited willpower to concentrate.\
In the evolving economy, the internet is part of bread and butter for many of us. Hence, avoiding the internet completely is not a practical approach.\
A few people take the path of digital-detox (taking "break" from the internet for a time period). However, eating healthy once in a week does not make you healthy right?\
Schedule in advance when you will use the internet and avoid it altogether in other time blocks. This preserves your attention span and avoids the effects of attention residue (as discussed earlier)

6\. Time to revisit the importance of social media --- List down all the social media tools you use and then justify their use by listing at least one possible positive benefit from using it. If these benefits outweigh the negative impacts AND align with your personal goals---then it justifies your social media tool.

7\. Schedule every minute of the day --- Most of us live our lives on auto-pilot. You may find yourself wondering a few evenings "It's already 8 pm". To be part of the rare set of people who have control over their life amidst the chaos --- we need to take hold of the steering wheel.\
Scheduling every minute may not be accurate from the first day. You may have to make come back, change, experiment, and then iterate every day.

The power of scheduling the day is highlighted in many books on focus and habit formation. Many people argue that this may turn life boring and robotic. However, scheduling every minute gives you control over your life. It leaves room for you to explore additional bits of life.

*Note: I tested most of the above rules for a few days after reading the book. Yet to see the results (as evolving), however, I do feel better each day :)*
