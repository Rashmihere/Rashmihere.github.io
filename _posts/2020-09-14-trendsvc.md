 ### Trends right into the inbox
Weekly emails sent by [Trends.vc](https://trends.vc/trends-0030-audience-first-products/) are one of the few weekly reports (or newsletters) that I never miss on reading.

**Why?**

1.  **Read the complete crisp report right in the inbox**

 -   The reward of opening the mail lies in the mail itself. I can choose not to visit the site and yet read the complete (free) report.\
    This differentiates the mails from Trends.vc from other newsletter/report mails where a plethora of things is offered to read.
 -   This may not directly route the traffic to their website via mails but IMO from acquisition PoV, this is a great move.

    That being said, I think the mail subject line can be improved to include the name of the "Trend" covered in the week.

    Probably Dru kept it this way to play with the curiosity element.

2\. **Clutter-free formatting and bulleted points**

 -   Black and white mail with no fancy texts or bright posters. This is very different from a traditional newsletter email.
 -   It is easier (at least for me) to read and process short sentences in bulleted points.
 -   There is a very subtle use of emojis and icons for different sections

3\. **Structure of the report**

 -   This is my favorite part of the mail\
    Problem > Solution > Players > Opportunities > Key Lessons > Haters > Links
 -   This information architecture is smooth and worth reading.
 -   The "Haters" section answers most (if not all) questions that are prompted while reading the report.

4\. **Subtle Placement of their paid product**

 -   Once I have read the complete free report and find the details interesting --- they subtly place the promotion of their paid product (with their value add)
