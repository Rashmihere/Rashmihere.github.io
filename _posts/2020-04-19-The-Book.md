Flipped through pages of my book in haste,
to get closer to the zenith which seemed ultimate.

Turned out, the new chapter was blank,
it embraced the void and the sanctity.

The novel smell fired my nonchalant cells,
which were stuck in the vicious webs of the past.

The heart thrilled and the red blood gushed,
as I tore down the pages that weighed down my book.

Untouched from fiction, this new chapter started dating the ink,
it rejoiced as the ink swirled and words poured down.

But, this time both were devoid of the bookâ€™s fate,
threads of stories weaved as they both danced.

I, now want to dive into this whirlpool,
want to get thrown away wasted
yet come back, hold back together.
